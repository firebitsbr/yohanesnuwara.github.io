For 4 years in the university (2015-2019), I only learned geophysics from the perspective of an **isotropic earth**.  However, I never learned, or even touched anything about **anisotropy**. This term 'anisotropy' has rung to my ears for long time, but I thought at that time I was not quite interested in it. Although I found out there has been tremendous researches on seismic anisotropy that were impactful to oil and gas exploration, anisotropy still seemed pretty abstract to me. 

In March 2020, I came across a colleague posting something interesting about anisotropy in LinkedIn. He posted about his research about wellbore stability in anisotropic formation using **Lekhnitskii-Amadei (1983)** modeling. Wellbore stability! This was a topic (an important topic in drilling) that at that time I was very interested in, when I still took **Reservoir Geomechanics** course by **Prof. Mark Zoback** from Stanford University. In the course, I learnt about wellbore stability modeling in **isotropic formation**, using **Kirsch (1898) modelling**. In his research, he discovered that Kirsch was not valid in anisotropic rock. This discovery was a blow to me. This is why I started to think I need to learn **anisotropy**, because it's nearer to my field now (which is geomechanics)! 

At first, I read at least 2 papers
