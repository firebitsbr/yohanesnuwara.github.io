For 4 years in the university (2015-2019), I only learned geophysics from the perspective of an **isotropic earth**.  However, I never learned, or even touched anything about **anisotropy**. This term 'anisotropy' has rung for long time to my ears, but I thought at that time I was not quite interested in it. Anisotropy seemed pretty abstract for me.
